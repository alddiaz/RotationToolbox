%% Quaternion normalization
% A unit quaternion q = [q1, q2, q3, q4]' has a real component
% q1 and a vector component given by v = [q2, q3, q4]'
% q(1) â‰¥ 0 is assumed and enforced to get an unambiguous representation

% The scalar quaternion component is positive by convention.
% This does not change the rotation the unit quaternion represents, since q and -q denote the same rotation.
